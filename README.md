# This is CS50 <br> CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science

<a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/">CS50</a> course is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages, via which I’ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that I’ll understand all the more because of C. Toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which I can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which I can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project.

### C language
I used to write on C, while studing in <a href="https://kpi.ua/en/about">National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”</a>. C is a fundamental language that every programmer should be comfortable with. Nevertheless, the <a hrerf="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/1/">problem set of **Week 1** in CS50</a> challenged me and pushed me to think harder than I expected.

In a file called hello.c
