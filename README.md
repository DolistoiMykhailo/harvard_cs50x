# This is CS50 <br> CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science

 [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

    <td width="60%">
      The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that
      underlies today’s newer languages, via which I’ll learn not only about
      functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how
      computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course
      then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that I’ll understand all
      the more because of C. Toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via
      which I can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
      via which I can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a
      final project.

## My path

This repository is my path of learning and developing as a programmer.

- [x] C([github_folder](https://github.com/mykhailodolitsoi/harvard_cs50x/tree/master/c)/[go_to_topic](#c-language))
- [ ] array(in progress)

### C language
I used to write on C, while studing in [National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”](https://kpi.ua/en/about). C is a fundamental language that every programmer should be comfortable with. Nevertheless, the [problem set of **Week 1** in CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/1/) challenged me and pushed me to think harder than I expected.

#### Task 1:
In the file hello.c, I implemented a simple program that waits for the user to enter their name and then prints a personalized greeting in the form:
hello, <*name*>.

The program contains one function:

main — uses the get_string function from the [CS50](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50?search=1) library.
